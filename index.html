    <!-- Chosen Palette: Modern Dark (Slate) with vibrant accents (Cyan, Emerald, Amber) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: Restructured layout for better flow: Charts first for an overview, then filters directly above the game list for intuitive interaction. Switched to a clean, modern dark theme. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Theme: Replaced NES.css with a custom, modern dark theme using TailwindCSS. Justification: Fulfills user request for a cleaner, but still "videogame themed," aesthetic.
        - Layout: Changed the genre filter from a scrollable row to a responsive grid (flex-wrap) to improve usability and visibility of all options.
        - Components: All components (cards, buttons, inputs) have been restyled to be cleaner and more modern.
        - Data: Curated and significantly expanded the dataset to strictly include games supporting 4 or more players with persistent progression, as requested.

## The Crafter's Paradise: More Survival & Building Epics

Given the strong preference for long-term, progression-based survival experiences, this new deep dive focuses exclusively on a fresh batch of titles that excel in this area. These games are for groups who want to build, explore, and overcome challenges in a persistent world, seeing their efforts shape the environment around them.

* **Abiotic Factor:** A standout title for fans of *Grounded*'s "structured survival" approach. Set in a sprawling underground research facility reminiscent of the Black Mesa facility from *Half-Life*, up to six players must use their scientific minds to survive a containment breach.[46] Progression is knowledge-based; you craft absurd weapons and tools from office supplies and lab equipment. It masterfully blends tense exploration with moments of comedy, creating a unique and compelling PvE experience.[47]

* **Sons Of The Forest:** The direct sequel to *The Forest*, this game takes everything that made the original great and expands upon it. The AI companions are smarter, the world is larger and more dynamic with changing seasons, and the building system is more freeform and intuitive.[33] It maintains the intense, terrifying atmosphere while giving up to eight players more tools and options to survive against the horrifying cannibalistic inhabitants.[34]

* **ECO:** This is a truly unique take on the genre, moving beyond personal survival to community survival. In *ECO*, up to 16 players are on a server and must advance their technology to stop a meteor from destroying the world, all without polluting the planet into oblivion.[48] Every action has a consequence on the simulated ecosystem. Progression is societal; players specialize in skills, propose laws, and must work together to create a functioning economy and government. It is a brilliant game for groups who want a deep, think-heavy collaborative project.[49]

* **Smalland: Survive the Wilds:** Another excellent choice for fans of the "shrunk down" subgenre, *Smalland* offers a vibrant, beautiful world to explore from the perspective of a tiny character. Up to 10 players can team up to build massive treetop bases, explore diverse biomes, and tame various insects and animals to serve as mounts.[50] The progression is tied to collecting new resources to craft better armor and weapons, allowing you to take on the world's tougher creatures, like spiders and birds.[51]

* **The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria:** For any fan of Tolkien's work, this game is a must-play. It is a survival-crafting game that tasks up to eight players with reclaiming the lost Dwarven kingdom of Khazad-dûm.[52] The core loop involves delving into the procedurally generated depths, mining for precious metals, fending off goblins and other dark creatures, and restoring the ancient halls of Moria to their former glory. Progression comes from crafting legendary Dwarven gear and slowly pushing back the darkness.[53]

## The Bargain Bin - Top-Tier Co-op Experiences Under $10

This section is a treasure map for the budget-conscious gamer. The Steam Summer Sale is the perfect time to build a world-class co-op library for less than the cost of a single new release. The following titles, all available for under $10, represent the absolute pinnacle of value, offering dozens, if not hundreds, of hours of top-tier cooperative gameplay with deep progression systems for a minimal investment.

* **Borderlands 3 ($2.99, -95%):** This deal is almost without precedent. A massive, graphically impressive AAA looter-shooter from just a few years ago, packed with a full campaign, deep skill trees, and endless endgame grinding, for the price of a cup of coffee. It is the single most valuable deal of the entire sale for any co-op group that enjoys frantic action and hunting for loot.

* **Terraria ($4.99, -50%):** A legendary title famous for its immense content-to-price ratio even at full price. At 50% off, it is an essential purchase. This 2D sandbox offers a vast world to explore, intricate crafting and building systems, and a long list of challenging bosses to conquer with your friends. Its progression is among the best in the genre.

* **Deep Rock Galactic ($9.89, -67%):** Arguably the best co-op game of the last decade, and an absolute steal for under $10. The progression is endless, with character promotions, hundreds of weapon upgrades, and game-changing Overclocks to hunt for in the deep, dark caves of Hoxxes IV.

* **The Division 2 ($8.99, -70%):** A massive, detailed open-world tactical shooter with an incredible amount of content for the price. The gear and build variety in the endgame provide a deep progression loop for a dedicated squad.

* **The Forest ($4.00, -80%):** For groups who want a pure survival experience with a terrifying horror twist, *The Forest* is a fantastic choice. Progression is tied to exploring a dangerous island to find better tools and blueprints, allowing you to build a more defensible and elaborate base against the cannibalistic hordes.

* **PlateUp! ($5.99, -70%):** This title brilliantly combines the chaotic kitchen management of games like *Overcooked* with deep roguelite progression. Between shifts, you permanently unlock new dishes, equipment, and restaurant layouts, allowing for complex and automated kitchen designs over time. It is a fantastic recipe for laughter, panic, and strategic planning.

    This game represents the perfect synthesis of price, quality, community, and progression. For under $10, it delivers a modern, endlessly replayable gameplay loop that masterfully blends horde shooting with meaningful objectives. Its four distinct classes necessitate true teamwork, and its progression systems—from character promotions to weapon overclocks—provide hundreds of hours of meaningful content.

At 50% off, it offers a complete, story-driven experience that can be enjoyed from start to finish with a full squad, making it a perfect example of its genre.

    Every sale offers the chance to discover a hidden gem, and this year, that title is *Abiotic Factor*.

The most effective way to leverage the Steam Summer Sale is to think like a curator for your group's library. Rather than purchasing a single full-priced game, a strategic approach allows for the acquisition of a diverse portfolio of co-op experiences. Consider assembling a "Co-op Starter Pack" by combining the strengths of each value tier: acquire a modern staple like **Deep Rock Galactic** for your primary, long-term game; add a premier survival-craft title like **Grounded** for a different kind of challenge; and then round out the collection with a handful of low-cost, high-replayability classics like **Left 4 Dead 2** and **Terraria**. This bundle approach provides a varied and long-lasting library that caters to every mood and session length, all for less than the cost of two new retail games. This strategy ensures that no matter what your group feels like playing, a perfect option is always ready to laun
